# Sources of Government Revenue

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Sources of Government Revenue](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/sources-of-government-revenue-in-the-oecd/) shows to what extent OECD and non-OECD countries rely on different tax revenue sources.

## The Dataset and its Tax Revenue Categories

### The Dataset
All the revenue data used in this publication comes from the OECD's Global Revenue Statistics Database (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RS_GBL). The dataset includes annual revenue data for almost 100 countries worldwide, dating back to 1965 for many OECD countries and to 1990 for a number of non-OECD countries. As of February 2020, the most recent data is 2018 for OECD countries and 2017 for non-OECD countries.

Details regarding the dataset can be found in "Revenue Statistics 1965-2017: Interpretative Guide," http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/oecd-classification-taxes-interpretative-guide.pdf.

### Revenue Categories
The OECD's Global Revenue Statistics Database provides various tax categories for the different tax revenue sources. For our report, we chose and combined these categories as follows:

* **Individual Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *1100 Taxes on income, profits and capital gains of individuals*.

* **Corporate Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *1200 Taxes on income, profits and capital gains of corporates*.

* **Social Insurance Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *2000 Social security contributions (SSC)*.

* **Property Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *4000 Taxes on property*.

* **Consumption Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *5000 Taxes on goods and services*.

* **Other:** Covers the OECD categories *1300 Unallocable between 1100 and 1200*, *3000 Taxes on payroll and workforce,* *6000 Taxes other than 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 and 5000*, and *Custom duties collected for the EU*.
