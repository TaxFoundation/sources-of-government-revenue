# Sources of Government Revenue

The Tax Foundation’s publication [Sources of Government Revenue in the OECD](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/sources-of-government-revenue-in-the-oecd/) shows to what extent OECD and non-OECD countries rely on different tax revenue sources.

## The Dataset and its Tax Revenue Categories and Scope

### The Dataset
All the revenue data used in this publication comes from the OECD's Global Revenue Statistics Database (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RS_GBL). The dataset includes annual revenue data for almost 100 countries worldwide, dating to 1965 for many OECD countries and 1990 for a number of non-OECD countries. As of February 2020, the most recent data is 2018 for OECD countries and 2017 for non-OECD countries.

Details regarding the OECD dataset can be found in “Revenue Statistics 1965-2017: Interpretative Guide,” http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/oecd-classification-taxes-interpretative-guide.pdf.
