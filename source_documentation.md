### **COUNTRY NOTES:**

* **All non-OECD countries:** Revenue data is from 2022 (2023 data not available as of April 2025).

* **Australia:** Revenue data is from 2022 (2023 data not available as of April 2025).

* **Ecuador:** The OECD dataset provides the tax revenue shares for the categories 1100, 1200, and 1300 only in currency values (as opposed to as a share of total revenue). Thus, shares had to be calculated based on the currency values.

* **Greece:** Only the aggregate of taxes on income, profits, and capital gains (category 1000) was available for the year 2023. To split this aggregate into the three categories of individual income taxes (1100), corporate income taxes (1200), and other income taxes (1300), the distribution of these categories in the year 2022 was used.

For the following countries, the OECD does not provide data for some tax categories. However, the sum of the categories that do contain data equals the total amount of taxes raised. As a result, the categories with missing data are set to zero.

 * Armenia (missing category: 3000)
 * Botswana (missing category: 1100 and 1200)
 * Cambodia (missing category: 2000)
 * Chad (missing category: 2000)
